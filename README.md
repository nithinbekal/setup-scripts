# Setup scripts for Elementary OS and Mac OSX

This script installs the tools I use on my work computer.

* Exuberant Ctags
* Git
* Homebrew (OSX - also homebrew-cask for installing desktop apps)
* Imagemagick
* RVM (also installs latest ruby and 2.1.2)
* Seil (OSX - for mapping ESC to CapsLock key)
* The Silver Searcher
* Tmux
* Vim (uses vim-gnome on Elementary and system vim on OSX)
* Zsh (default shell, with oh-my-zsh)
